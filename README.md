We propose the Symbiotic Convolution Block (SCB), a simple yet effective attention-free module for feed-forward convolutional neural networks. SCB implicitly promotes feature diversification and recalibration by fusing shared and mutated convolutional pathways within each block, inspired by symbiotic and evolutionary principles, without using explicit attention maps, gating, or importance scoring. SCB is lightweight, general-purpose, and can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN architecture with negligible overhead. It is fully end-to-end trainable together with the base network.
